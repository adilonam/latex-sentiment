\chapter*{Abstract}

\lettrine[nindent=0em, slope=-.5em] {\color{Eblue}T}{his} document is a summary of our end-of-year project conducted within the company \textbf{Code212}. During this internship, we had the opportunity to work on an IT project aimed at integrating an intelligent chatbot into the \textbf{Code212} e-learning platform.

\ \\

\lettrine[nindent=0em, slope=-.5em] {\color{Eblue}T}{he} project involves creating and integrating an AI chatbot into a web application dedicated to online training and managing courses and certificates for students. The platform users include students, managers, and administrators. Students will be able to interact with the chatbot to get information about courses, register for events and certification exams, and receive personalized assistance. Managers will have the ability to create, modify, and delete courses, events, and certificates. Administrators will be responsible for managing users and ensuring the smooth operation of the platform.

\ \\

\lettrine[nindent=0em, slope=-.5em] {\color{Eblue}T}{he} AI chatbot is designed to improve the efficiency and accessibility of online training services, providing immediate and personalized assistance to users. With this integration, students will benefit from an interactive and intuitive interface, facilitating their learning journey.

\ \\

\lettrine[nindent=0em, slope=-.5em] {\color{Eblue}I}{n} order to manage this project effectively, we opted for the \textbf{SCRUM} methodology and divided the different modules into sprints. An initial sprint was initiated to perform a comprehensive functional analysis and build a baseline model for the following sprints. After completing the initial sprint, we executed the other sprints, each dedicated to the detailed design of a module of the application, followed by the development of its prototypes, and finally its implementation.

\ \\

\lettrine[nindent=0em, slope=-.5em] {\color{Eblue}I}{n} summary, the project aims to integrate an AI chatbot into an e-learning platform, offering an enhanced learning experience for students and efficient management of courses and events for managers and administrators. This integration ensures smooth and secure interaction while increasing the accessibility and efficiency of \textbf{Code212}'s online educational services.
